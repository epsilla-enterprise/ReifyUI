// Voice input, using the recogniser the browser already has.
//
// Chrome, Edge and Safari ship SpeechRecognition, and it is exactly the feature — speak, get text
// in the box. Where the API is absent, createDictation() returns null and the caller renders no
// button at all. A disabled microphone labelled "coming soon" is a control that does nothing,
// which is worse than its absence: it says the product has a capability it does not have. Three
// of the four panels this package now serves shipped exactly that button; returning null is what
// makes the honest version the easy one to write.
//
// Nothing here is agent- or product-specific, which is why it is a root export rather than part
// of a transport: it turns speech into a string and stops.
